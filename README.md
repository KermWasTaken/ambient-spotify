# Ambient Spotify

## A web app that mixes ambient noises with your favorite Spotify songs

This idea came to me tonight while listening to some Sufjan Stevens. I wanted the ability to mix in ambient noises to broaden the soundscape in my headphones, but in order to do this, it always requires opening up additional tabs on youtube. The following events typically consist of dragging volume sliders up and down, back and forth, until your satisified. So to ambient spotify, this is the beginning of project to create an app that integrates spotify and allows users to easily mix in various ambient noises such as rain or the crackling of a camp fire.
